# Question 1 what is the difference between git and github
## what is git 
 Git is a open source version control system a version control system is a software which can save changes made to a program overtime so it can basically
 track every version of our code each time we make a change to it.
 ## what is github
 github is a website where we can host all our git repositories(a repository is essentially like a folder)through github we can share our code with other team members
 and they can also work on the same project as we are. Github also makes it easy to organise our project in a porfolio which can be shown to potential employers
 # Question 2 Explain very briefly any 5 basic git commands
 ## clone: 
 clone command copies a remote repo hosted on a website like github to our computer(local machine).
 ## add:
 add command saves the changes made to a queue so that these changes can be tracked, it doesn't commit the changes made to the main file
 ## commit :
 saves the changes to git
 ## push :
 push command saves the changes made to the files on your local machine to a remote repo
 ## pull :
 if some changes are made to our code in the remote repo(that is on github or a website like that) the pull command is used to download the changes 
 to our local machine.
 # How to make a pull request
  * first go to a repo that we want to contribute to 
  * then select the repo and then click on the fork option. forking creates a copy of the repo on our account which we can make any changes to without affecting
  the original repo.
  * make the required changes, we can either make changes directly to the master branch on our copy of the repo or create a new branch and save changes there.
  * Then we click on create pull request and add a title and a description of the changes we have made to the repo .
  * Then the owner of the original repo can pull the changes we have made and add them to the original repo if he/she wants
